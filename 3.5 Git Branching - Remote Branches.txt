* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/sumitk39/hello-world.git

  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (fast-forwardable)

$ git checkout origin/master
Note: checking out 'origin/master'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 9d7a9f8... Merge pull request #1 from sumitk39/readme-edits

kesavan@ENTOSS MINGW64 /e/EntossTechSW/test/hello-world ((9d7a9f8...))
$ git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was 9d7a9f8... Merge pull request #1 from sumitk39/readme-edits
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 5 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
